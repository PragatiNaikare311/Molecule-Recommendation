# Molecule-Recommendation


The research project aims to design and implement a hybrid chemical recommender system.
This system will leverage a combination of algorithms, including collaborative filtering,
content-based approaches, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and autoencoders to effectively
identify and recommend compounds of interest. It focuses on introducing scientific re-
searchers to potentially unknown chemical compounds within large-scale chemical datasets,
enhancing discovery and research efficiency in chemistry and related fields
